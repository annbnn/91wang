PHP Code Indentation Specifications
The Importance of Indentation
When writing PHP code, it is crucial to maintain good indentation habits to improve the readability and maintainability of the code. Indentation not only helps developers clearly see the structure of the code but also makes the code easier to understand and modify.

Recommended Indentation Style
Use spaces instead of tabs: It is recommended to use two spaces for indentation instead of tabs. This helps maintain consistency and cleanliness in the code.

Indent Size: It is generally recommended to use four spaces as one indentation level.

The application scenarios of indentation
Control Structures: In control structures such as if, while, and for, ensure that there is proper spacing between the condition statement's opening parenthesis and the keyword, and that curly braces are always paired.

Function and Method Definitions: Consistent indentation style should also be maintained within function and method definitions to enhance the overall readability of the code.

Follow the PSR Coding Standards
PSR-2 Code Style Guide
PSR-2 is an encoding style specification formulated by the PHP Standards Recommendation Association, which details specific rules for indentation, naming, comments, and other aspects of PHP code.

Basic Coding Standards
Namespace: Use namespaces to organize code and avoid conflicts between class and function names.

Function and Method Naming: It is recommended to use verbs to describe the operations of functions in order to enhance code readability.

Variable Naming: Use camelCase notation and employ descriptive names.

Control Structure
if statement: There should be a space between the keyword and the opening parenthesis, and if is always paired with its corresponding curly braces.

Switch Statement: Actions follow case labels directly, with a break statement after each case, and the default behavior with the default label at the end.

Improve code readability and maintainability
Principle of Consistency
Maintaining consistency is one of the core principles of PHP code standards. Using the same naming conventions, indentation styles, code comments, etc. throughout the codebase makes it easier for team members to understand and read the code, reducing the likelihood of errors and confusion.

Principle of Readability
To improve code readability, use meaningful variable and function names, avoid overly complex expressions and nested structures. Also, appropriate comments can help other developers better understand your intent and the functionality of the code.

Principle of conciseness
Write concise and clear code, avoiding overly complex statements and functions as much as possible. This helps improve the execution efficiency and maintainability of the code.

Other Principles
In addition to the aforementioned principles, other important principles of PHP code standards include reusability, testability, security, and performance. Adhering to these principles can help developers write higher quality, more robust PHP code.

By adhering to these guidelines and principles, developers can not only improve the readability and maintainability of their code but also foster team collaboration and enhance overall development efficiency.
